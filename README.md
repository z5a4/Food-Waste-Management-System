•	The Food Waste Management System is a comprehensive solution developed by an NGO to address the critical issue of food waste. 
  It aims to streamline the process of collecting, converting, and distributing food waste to minimize its environmental impact
  and contribute to community welfare. 
•	The system comprises multiple actors including Admin, Clerk, Volunteer, Transporter, Food Waste Requester, and Farmer, each with 
  specific roles and responsibilities. Requests for food waste collection can be occasional or regular, with occasional requests requiring 
  no registration and regular requests necessitating registration. 
•	Route schedules are generated daily to optimize waste collection routes for Volunteers and Transporters. 
  Collected food waste is transported to the biogas plant where it undergoes conversion into slurry.
  This slurry is then distributed to registered farmers based on their requests, with a 15-day request cycle for farmers to place new orders. 
•	Payment to Transporters is managed based on predetermined charges and rates for their services.
  The system maintains comprehensive records of collected waste, produced slurry, and transactional data for efficient management and reporting purposes. 
•	The Food Waste Management System aims to mitigate environmental pollution, promote sustainable agricultural practices, engage the community in waste management 
  initiatives, enhance efficiency in waste management processes, and contribute to the overall well-being of society.
•	Key features include request management, route optimization, biogas plant operations, slurry distribution, payment management, and reporting/analytics tools, 
  all aimed at streamlining operations and maximizing impact.
•	By embracing innovation, collaboration, and continuous improvement, the Food Waste Management System strives to make a meaningful difference in the fight 
  against food waste and contribute to a healthier, more sustainable future for all.
