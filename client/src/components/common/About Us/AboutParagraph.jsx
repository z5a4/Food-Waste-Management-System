    "Our vision is to spread this initiative not only within our state but across the entire country. 
    We aim to establish a comprehensive network for the systematic collection of food waste from 
    various sources nationwide. By collaborating with businesses, institutions, and communities, we 
    strive to ensure the efficient and sustainable management of food waste on a large scale.

    Once collected, our goal is to process this food waste into nutrient-rich slurry through advanced 
    bio-conversion technologies. This slurry will then be distributed to farmers across the country, free 
    of charge. Our primary objective is to support and empower our farmers by providing them with a valuable 
    resource that enhances soil fertility and promotes sustainable agricultural practices.

    In addition to addressing food waste management challenges, our initiative aims to contribute to the 
    overall welfare of farmers and the agricultural sector. By reducing their input costs and improving soil 
    health, we envision a future where farmers can achieve higher yields and greater economic prosperity.

    Through continuous expansion and innovation, we aspire to make a meaningful and lasting impact on food 
    waste reduction, agricultural sustainability, and the well-being of farming communities nationwide."

    <Typography variant="lead" className="mt-6 ml-16 mr-16 mb-12 pl-15 pr-15 item-center"  style={{ textAlign: 'justify-center' }}>
    The Food Waste Management System is an innovative project aimed at addressing the critical issue of food waste in a sustainable and 
    environmentally friendly manner. <br></br>
    This system focuses on creating a comprehensive solution that involves the collaboration of hotels, bio gas plants, and farmers.<br></br> 
    By leveraging technology and efficient processes, the project aims to collect leftover food which will be provided by certain hotels, 
    various events, weddings and then after collection of food, the food waste will be sent to the bio plant and then the bio plant will 
    convert the food waste into valuable resource known as slurry which is useful for agriculture use, and after we got slurry as a byproduct
    of food waste conversion it will be provided to farmers for free and a single farmer can get slurry on request within certain days limit.
